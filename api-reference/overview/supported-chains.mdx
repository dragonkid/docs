## Chain ID

When calling Web3 API, you can use the **Network ID** listed in the table below as the `chain_id` parameter. Chainbase Web3 API only supports EVM-compatible blockchains for now.

We will continue to add support for new blockchains. If there is a chain that you wish to support but we do not, please let us know by reaching out to [support@chainbase.com](mailto:support@chainbase.com).
