title: "Reverse Resolve ENS Domain"
---

Reverse resolving an ENS name involves retrieving the address associated with a given ENS name. This can be useful in cases where you need to verify the ownership of an ENS name or interact with a smart contract associated with the name. By using Chainbase API [Reverse resolve ENS domain](/api-reference/web3-api/domain/ens-domain-endpoints/reverse-resolve-ens-domain), you can easily reverse resolve an ENS name and retrieve the associated address on Ethereum or other chains.

It's important to note that reverse resolving an ENS name only works for names that have been registered on the blockchain. If a name has not been registered, it will not have an associated address and therefore cannot be reverse resolved.

## Overview - Tools you need to work with Chainbase

1. A free account at [Chainbase](https://www.chainbase.com) with an API key.
2. An IDE. Our examples are shown in JavaScript, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your IDE for example.
3. A wallet address as your input.

## Step 1: Set up a free account at Chainbase

To better leverage the ability that Chainbase provides, you can register [here](http://www.chainbase.com/register) for a free account and access to different APIs and data cloud.

After logging into Chainbase, visit the [dashboard](https://console.chainbase.com/) to get an overview. Create a new project in the console and get an API key.

## Step 2: Write script using Chainbase API

1. Using `fetch` in JavaScript.

```jsx
network_id = '1'; // See https://docs.chainbase.com/reference/supported-chains to get the id of different chains.
wallet_addr = '0x57511688c0ca7Cc7C25B90aE51C62B64652136Ac'; // Take our CTO Xiaocong's wallet address as an example.

fetch(`https://api.chainbase.online/v1/ens/reverse?chain_id=${network_id}&address=${wallet_addr}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'x-api-key': CHAINBASE_API_KEY, // Replace the field with your API key.
        'accept': 'application/json'
    }
}).then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

2. Using `axios` in JavaScript. You need to install `axios` using `npm install axios --save` in the terminal first.

```jsx
network_id = '1'; // See https://docs.chainbase.com/reference/supported-chains to get the id of different chains.
wallet_addr = '0x57511688c0ca7Cc7C25B90aE51C62B64652136Ac'; // Take our CTO Xiaocong's wallet address as an example.

const axios = require('axios');
const options = {
    url: `https://api.chainbase.online/v1/ens/reverse?chain_id=${network_id}&address=${wallet_addr}`,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'x-api-key': CHAINBASE_API_KEY, // Replace the field with your API key.
        'accept': 'application/json'
    }
};
axios(options)
    .then(response => console.log(response.data.data))
    .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

## Step 3: Print the reversed resolved ENS domain

Chainbase API [Reverse resolve ENS domain](/api-reference/web3-api/domain/ens-domain-endpoints/reverse-resolve-ens-domain) takes the chain id and wallet address as parameters, and returns the reversed resolved ENS domain name.

To get data printed, run command `node <filename>.js` in the terminal. In this case, the corresponding domain name of Xiaocong’s wallet on Ethereum is `lxcong`, which means you can get the wallet address using `lxcong.eth`.

```jsx
[
  {
    "address": "0x57511688c0ca7cc7c25b90ae51c62b64652136ac",
    "expiration_time": "2023-04-17T14:19:21Z",
    "name": "lxcong",
    "owner": "0x57511688c0ca7Cc7C25B90aE51C62B64652136Ac",
    "registrant": "0x57511688c0ca7cc7c25b90ae51c62b64652136ac",
    "registrant_time": "2022-04-17T08:30:09Z",
    "resolver": "0x4976fb03c32e5b8cfe2b6ccb31c09ba78ebaba41",
    "text_records": {},
    "token_id": "63135721284494715790867739452503301817186787830065141439742276093364926543362"
  }
]
```
