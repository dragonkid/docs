title: "Get NFT owners by collection"
---

If you’re interested in the market of NFTs, it’s essential to know who the current owners of particular NFT collection are. Here are some steps to follow to get the owner information:

1. First, you need to identify the blockchain platform that the NFT collection is built on. Popular blockchain platforms for NFTs include Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and so on.
2. Once you know the blockchain platform, you can use a blockchain explorer to search for the NFT contract address. A blockchain explorer is a tool that allows you to view transaction data on the blockchain.
3. After you find the NFT contract address, you can use Chainbase API [Get NFT owners by collection](/api-reference/web3-api/nft/nft-ownership/get-nft-owners-by-collection) to get all the owners of that NFT collection.

The following tutorial shows how to use Chainbase to get all the owners of a certain NFT collection. With this information, you can see who the largest holder of an NFT collection is.

## Overview - Tools you need to work with Chainbase

1. A free account at [Chainbase](https://www.chainbase.com) with an API key.
2. An IDE. Our examples are shown in JavaScript, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your IDE for example.
3. The contract address of a known NFT collection as your input.

## Step 1: Set up a free account at Chainbase

To better leverage the ability that Chainbase provides, you can register [here](http://www.chainbase.com/register) for a free account and access to different APIs and data cloud.

After logging into Chainbase, visit the [dashboard](https://console.chainbase.com/) to get an overview. Create a new project in the console and get an API key.

## Step 2: Write script using Chainbase API

1. Using `fetch` in JavaScript.

```jsx
network_id = '1'; // See https://docs.chainbase.com/reference/supported-chains to get the id of different chains.
contract_addr = '0xed5af388653567af2f388e6224dc7c4b3241c544'; // Take Azuki's contract address as an example.

fetch(`https://api.chainbase.online/v1/nft/owners?chain_id=${network_id}&contract_address=${contract_addr}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'x-api-key': CHAINBASE_API_KEY, // Replace the field with your API key.
        'accept': 'application/json'
    }
}).then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

2. Using `axios` in JavaScript. You need to install `axios` using `npm install axios --save` in the terminal first.

```jsx
network_id = '1'; // See https://docs.chainbase.com/reference/supported-chains to get the id of different chains.
contract_addr = '0xed5af388653567af2f388e6224dc7c4b3241c544'; // Take Azuki's contract address as an example.

const axios = require('axios');
const options = {
    url: `https://api.chainbase.online/v1/nft/owners?chain_id=${network_id}&contract_address=${contract_addr}`,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'x-api-key': CHAINBASE_API_KEY, // Replace the field with your API key.
        'accept': 'application/json'
    }
};
axios(options)
    .then(response => console.log(response.data.data))
    .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

## Step 3: Print the owners of the NFT collection

Chainbase API [Get NFT owners by collection](/api-reference/web3-api/nft/nft-ownership/get-nft-owners-by-collection) takes the chain id and NFT contract address as parameters, and returns the holders’ address and the corresponding total. You can also get the total holder number in the `count` column of the returned data.

To get data printed, run command `node <filename>.js` in the terminal. In this case, the `data` column of the returned data looks as follows.

```jsx
{
  "address": "0xd46c8648f2ac4ce1a1aace620460fbd24f640853",
  "total": 374
},
{
