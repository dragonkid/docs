## What is Data Cloud?

The Chainbase Data Cloud lets you run your low-latency queries through an endpoint to leverage all our indexed datasets for your custom needs. Chainbase's [Data Cloud](/platform/datasets/overview) is a fully managed online data warehouse service for Web3 developers.  Developers can query the data warehouse through the **API** to access our datasets with zero infra cost.  And the **Data Cloud**'s scalable, distributed analytical data engine and intelligent data modeling allow you to query terabytes of data **in seconds**.

## Quickstart

Query the hashes of the last 3,000 blocks in Ethereum and the number of transactions in each block:

```bash
curl -X "POST" "https://api.chainbase.online/v1/dw/query" \
     -H 'X-API-KEY: YOUR-API-KEY ' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "query": "select number, transactions_count from ethereum.blocks order by number desc limit 3000;"
}'
```

If there are more than 1000 rows, you need to paginate through the`task_id` and `page` to get all the results:

```bash
curl -X "POST" "https://api.chainbase.online/v1/dw/query" \
     -H 'X-API-KEY: YOUR-API-KEY ' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
       "task_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
       "page": 2
}'
```
